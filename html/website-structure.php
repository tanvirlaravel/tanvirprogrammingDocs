      <h3>Defination</h3>
        <div>
            <p>In addition to defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML also boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column"). </p>
        

            <p>HTML metadata is typically contained in the <head> element of an HTML document. There are several types of metadata that can be included in the <head> element, including:</p>
        <hr />
        <hr />
        </div>


        <h3>header</h3>
        <div>
            <p>In HTML, the <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. It is typically used to group together a set of navigation links, a logo or other branding elements, a search form, and/or other elements that belong at the top of a page.</p>
            <p>Note that the <header> element should not be used to represent a page header or banner. For that purpose, you should use the <div> element with a class or id name that identifies it as a header or banner.</p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <div>
      <p>Metadata is important for search engines and other web applications because it helps them understand the content and context of a webpage, which can influence how the webpage is ranked or displayed. It can also be used to improve the user experience, such as by specifying the character encoding of a webpage or providing a link to a favicon.</p>
