      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <div>
        <p>At its heart, HTML is a language made up of <code>elements</code>, which can be applied to pieces of text to give them different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list? Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections (Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?), and embed content such as images and videos into a page. </p>
