      <h3>Defination</h3>
      <div>
      <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language used for creating and structuring content on the World Wide Web. It is used to define the structure and layout of a webpage, and to specify the content and formatting of text, images, and other elements on the page.</p>

      <h3>Tags</h3>
      <div>
        <p>HTML is a text-based format that consists of a series of tags, which are used to define the structure and layout of the content. These tags are surrounded by angle brackets and are usually paired, with a start tag (e.g., &lt;p>) and an end tag (e.g., &lt;/p>). The content of an HTML element is placed between the start and end tags.</p>

        In this example, the DOCTYPE html> declaration specifies that this is an HTML5 document. The html> element encloses the entire document, while the head> element contains metadata about the document, such as the title, and the body> element contains the actual content of the webpage. The h1> element defines a heading, and the p> element defines a paragraph.

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <div>
        <p>HTML is used in conjunction with other technologies, such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity. Together, these technologies form the basis for creating modern, dynamic websites.</p>
