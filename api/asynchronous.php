            <h3>Defination</h3>
            <p>Asynchronous programming refers to a programming model in which multiple tasks can be executed concurrently (in parallel) rather than sequentially (one after the other). This allows programs to handle multiple tasks at the same time and can improve the performance and responsiveness of applications..</p>

            <p>In asynchronous programming, tasks are often represented using asynchronous functions or asynchronous patterns such as Promises or async/await. These patterns allow developers to write code that can be executed asynchronously, without blocking the main thread of execution. This means that the program can continue to execute other tasks while waiting for the results of an asynchronous task to be returned.</p>

            <p>Asynchronous programming can be useful in a variety of contexts, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Web development: Asynchronous programming can improve the performance and responsiveness of web applications by allowing them to perform multiple tasks in parallel, such as making network requests or processing user input.</li>
                <li>Mobile app development: Asynchronous programming can improve the performance and responsiveness of mobile apps by allowing them to perform tasks in the background or while the app is not in the foreground.</li>
                <li>Data processing: Asynchronous programming can improve the performance of data processing tasks by allowing them to be executed in parallel, rather than sequentially.</li>
               
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, asynchronous programming is a powerful tool for improving the performance and responsiveness of applications and is widely used in a variety of programming contexts.</p>
