            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>A JavaScript framework is a collection of pre-written JavaScript code that allows developers to build web applications more quickly and easily. It provides a structure for organizing and building JavaScript code, and includes a set of libraries and tools that make it easier to develop web applications by providing common functions and features that can be used out of the box.</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>JavaScript frameworks can help developers build complex web applications more quickly by providing a set of reusable components and tools, and can also help improve the performance and maintainability of the codebase by providing a consistent structure and coding conventions. However, it is important for developers to choose the right framework for their project, as each framework has its own strengths and limitations, and may not be suitable for every use case.</p>
