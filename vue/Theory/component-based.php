          <p>Vue is a component-based JavaScript framework, which means that it provides a way to break down a web application into smaller, reusable parts called components. Components are self-contained, reusable blocks of code that define a part of a user interface, such as a button, form, or list item.</p>
          <p>Vue components encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code needed to render a part of the user interface. Each component can have its own <a href="http://tanvirprogrammingdocs.test/vue/Theory/state_and_reactivity.php" target="_blank">state</a>, which can be modified by events and actions triggered by the user or other components. Changes in the component's state are automatically reflected in the UI, thanks to Vue's reactive data binding system.</p>
          <p>Component-based development is a popular approach for building complex web applications, as it allows developers to break down the application into smaller, more manageable parts. Components can be reused across different parts of the application, reducing duplication of code and making it easier to maintain and update the application over time.</p>
          <p>Vue's component-based architecture is designed to make it easy to create, reuse, and manage components, using a simple and intuitive API. With Vue, developers can create modular and flexible web applications that are easy to scale and maintain.</p>
