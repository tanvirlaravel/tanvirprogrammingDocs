            <h3 id="foreign-key">Driver</h3>
            <p>A database driver is a software component that allows an application to communicate with a specific database management system (DBMS). It acts as an interface between the application and the database, providing the necessary functionality to establish a connection, send queries, and retrieve results.</p>
            <p>Different database management systems have their own specific protocols and APIs for interacting with databases. Therefore, each DBMS requires a specific driver to facilitate communication with that particular system.</p>
            <p>In the context of PHP and web development, popular database drivers include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>MySQL: The MySQL driver allows PHP applications to connect to and interact with MySQL databases.</li>
                <li>PostgreSQL: The PostgreSQL driver enables PHP applications to work with PostgreSQL databases.</li>
                <li>SQLite: The SQLite driver allows PHP applications to utilize SQLite databases.</li>
                <li>SQL Server: The SQL Server driver allows PHP applications to connect to and interact with Microsoft SQL Server databases.</li>
                <li>Oracle: The Oracle driver enables PHP applications to work with Oracle databases.</li>
                
            </ol>
            <p>These database drivers provide the necessary functions and methods to establish connections, execute queries, fetch results, and manage transactions with their respective database management systems.</p>
            <p>In a PHP application, you typically specify the desired database driver and configure the necessary connection details (e.g., hostname, username, password, database name) in the application's configuration files or environment variables. This information is then used by the chosen database driver to establish a connection to the appropriate database.</p>
