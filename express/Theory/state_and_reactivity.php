           <h3>State</h3>
           <p>In Vue.js, "state" refers to <code>the data</code> that is stored and managed by a Vue instance or component. The state is used to represent the current state of the application or component, including user input, fetched data, and any other information that needs to be stored and manipulated by the application.</p>

           <p>Vue state is typically stored in a data object within a Vue component, which is then used to render the component's template. When the state changes, Vue automatically re-renders the component to reflect the updated state.</p>

           <hr>

           <h3>Reactivity</h3>
           <p>In Vue.js, reactivity is a feature that allows the framework to automatically track changes to data and update the user interface accordingly. When a piece of data changes, Vue automatically detects the change and re-renders the relevant parts of the user interface to reflect the updated data.</p>
           <p>Reactivity is implemented in Vue using a technique called "dependency tracking". When a component is created, Vue analyzes the component's template to determine which data properties are used to render the template. Vue then creates a dependency graph that tracks which parts of the template depend on which data properties.</p>
           <p>When a data property is updated, Vue automatically re-evaluates the relevant parts of the dependency graph and re-renders the affected components. This makes it easy to create reactive user interfaces without having to manually update the DOM in response to data changes.</p>
           <p>Reactivity is also a core feature of React, another popular JavaScript framework. React uses a similar technique called "virtual DOM diffing" to efficiently update the user interface in response to changes in data. However, the implementation of reactivity in React is somewhat different from Vue, and React components are typically written using a different syntax and architecture.</p>
