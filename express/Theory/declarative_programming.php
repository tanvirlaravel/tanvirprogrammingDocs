           <p>Declarative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on describing what should be done, rather than how to do it. In declarative programming, you define the result that you want to achieve, and the computer determines how to achieve that result based on the rules and logic you've provided.</p>
           <p>Declarative programming is often contrasted with imperative programming, which involves giving the computer step-by-step instructions on how to achieve a particular outcome. In declarative programming, you provide a set of instructions, and the computer is responsible for figuring out how to execute them.</p>
           <p>Declarative programming is used in many different contexts, including user interfaces, databases, and markup languages. For example, in a user interface, you might declare the layout and structure of the interface using declarative code, rather than writing low-level instructions for each element.</p>
           <p>Overall, declarative programming can make code easier to read, write, and maintain, since it focuses on the desired outcome rather than the implementation details.</p>
