           <h3>User interface (UI) </h3>
           <p>A user interface (UI) is the point of interaction between a user and a computer. It includes the visual elements that the user sees and interacts with, such as the buttons, menus, and text that make up a graphical user interface (GUI), as well as the commands and input methods used in a command-line interface (CLI).</p>
           <p>The goal of a good UI is to make it easy and intuitive for the user to interact with the computer and accomplish their tasks. A good UI should be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and responsive to the user's actions.</p>
           <p>There are many different types of UI, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and web-based interfaces. Each type of UI has its own strengths and is suited to different tasks and users. For example, a GUI is often used for tasks that require a lot of visual input and output, while a CLI is better suited for tasks that involve typing commands and receiving text-based output.</p>
