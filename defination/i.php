           <h3>Imperative programming</h3>
                <p>Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on specifying how a program should accomplish a task, rather than just describing what it should do. In imperative programming, the programmer writes code that specifies the steps and algorithms needed to solve a problem, and the programming language or system executes those steps in the order specified.</p>
                <p>One example of an imperative programming language is C, which is a low-level language that provides a wide range of control structures and low-level operations for working with memory and hardware. Another example is Python, which is a high-level language that provides a variety of control structures and data types for solving a wide range of problems.</p>

                <p>Imperative programming can be more flexible and powerful than declarative programming, as it allows the programmer to specify the exact steps and algorithms needed to solve a problem. However, it can also be more verbose and error-prone, as the programmer must specify all of the details of the solution themselves.</p>

             <h3>Interface (oop)</h3>
             <p>In computer science, an interface is a set of methods or behaviors that a class can implement. It is a way to specify a contract that a class must follow, without requiring the class to actually implement the methods.</p>
             <p>Interfaces are useful because they allow you to define a set of common behaviors that multiple classes can implement, without requiring those classes to have a common inheritance hierarchy. This can make it easier to design flexible and reusable code.</p>
