           <h3>Memory</h3>
           <p>In computing, memory refers to a device or component of a computer that is used to store data, programs, and other information that can be accessed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). Memory is a key component of a computer, as it is used to store data that the CPU needs to access quickly in order to carry out its tasks.</p>
                <p>A memory is just like a human brain. It is used to store data and instructions. Computer memory is the storage space in the computer, where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored. The memory is divided into large number of small parts called cells. Each location or cell has a unique address, which varies from zero to memory size minus one. For example, if the computer has 64k words, then this memory unit has 64 * 1024 = 65536 memory locations. The address of these locations varies from 0 to 65535.</p>

                <p>In computing, memory refers to a device that is used to store information for immediate use in a computer or related computer hardware device.[1] It typically refers to semiconductor memory, specifically metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) memory,[2][3] where data is stored within MOS memory cells on a silicon integrated circuit chip.</p>
                <p>Most semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells or bistable flip-flops, each storing one bit (0 or 1).</p>

                <p>There are several types of memory used in computers, including:−</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>RAM (random access memory): This is the main memory used by the computer to store data that the CPU needs to access quickly. RAM is volatile memory, which means that it is wiped clean when the computer is powered off.</li>
                    <li>ROM (read-only memory): This type of memory is used to store permanent or semi-permanent data, such as the BIOS of a computer. ROM is non-volatile memory, which means that it retains its data even when the power is off.</li>
                    <li>Cache memory: This is a type of memory that is used to store frequently accessed data in a location that is faster to access than main memory. Cache memory is typically located on the CPU itself or on a separate chip close to the CPU.</li>
                    <li>Hard drive: A hard drive is a type of non-volatile storage that is used to store large amounts of data for long periods of time. Hard drives are slower than RAM, but they are much more durable and can store much more data.</li>                   
                   
                </ul>
                <p>Memory is typically measured in bytes (B), kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), or terabytes (TB). The amount of memory a computer has can have a big impact on its performance, as more memory can allow the computer to store more data and access it more quickly.</p>

          <h3>Machine code</h3>
          <p>Machine code, also known as machine language or assembly language, is a set of instructions that a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute directly. It is the lowest-level programming language, and it consists of a series of binary digits (ones and zeros) that represent the commands that the CPU should carry out.</p>
          <p>Machine code is typically not written by humans, as it is difficult for humans to read and write directly in binary. Instead, programmers write code in a higher-level programming language, such as C++ or Python, which is then compiled into machine code by a compiler. The compiler reads the source code and translates it into the series of binary instructions that the CPU can understand.</p>
          <p>Machine code is specific to a particular type of CPU and its architecture, so machine code for one type of CPU will not necessarily work on another type of CPU. This means that machine code is not portable, and it has to be re-compiled for each type of CPU it is intended to run on.
        </p>
