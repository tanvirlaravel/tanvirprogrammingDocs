           <h3>Run vs Compile times</h3>
           <p>Compiling and running are two different stages in the process of executing a program.</p>
           <p>Compiling refers to the process of converting source code written in a programming language (such as C++ or Java) into machine code that can be executed by a computer. This process is usually done by a compiler, which is a program that reads the source code and translates it into machine code.</p>
           <p>Running refers to the process of actually executing the compiled program on a computer. This involves loading the machine code into memory and starting the program's execution.</p>
           <p>In general, compiling a program takes longer than running it, because the compiler has to read and analyze the entire source code and generate machine code for every instruction. Running a program, on the other hand, simply involves executing the machine code that has already been generated.</p>
           <p>However, the actual time it takes to compile and run a program can vary depending on a number of factors, such as the size and complexity of the program, the speed of the computer, and the efficiency of the compiler.</p>
