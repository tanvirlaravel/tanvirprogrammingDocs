     <h2 class="text-info">Introduction</h2>
     <p>Object-oriented programming is a programming style in which it is customary to group all of
        the variables and functions of a particular topic into a single class.it supports better code organization, provides modularity, and reduces the need to repeat ourselves. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-info">How to create classes</h2>
        <p>we can group all of the code that handles the users of a blog into one class, all of the code that is
            involved with the publication of the posts in the blog into a second class, and all the code that is
            devoted to comments into a third class</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>We write the name of the class and capitalize the first letter</li>
            <li>If the class name contains more than one word, we capitalize each word. This is known as
                upper camel case. For example, <code>JapaneseCars, AmericanIdol, EuropeTour,</code> etc.
                </li>
            <li>
                If the property name contains more than one word, all of the words, except for the first word, start with
an upper case letter. For example, <code>$color or $hasSunRoof</code>.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2 class="text-info">How to create objects from a class</h2>
        <p>The process of creating an object is also known as <strong><code>instantiation</code></strong>.</p>

        <h2 class="text-info">Objects what are they good for?</h2>
        <p>
            While in the procedural style of programming, all of the functions and variables sit together in the
<strong><code>global scope</code></strong> in a way that allows their use just by calling their name, the use of classes makes
anything inside the classes hidden from the global scope. Thatâ€™s because the code inside the classes
is encapsulated within the <strong><code>class scope</code></strong>, outside the reach of the global scope. So, we need a way to
allow the code from the global scope to use the code within the class, and we do this by creating
objects from a class

        <h2 class="text-info">How to add methods to a class?</h2>
        <p>If the name contains more than one word, all of the words, except for the first word, start with
            an upper case letter. For example, <code>helloUser() or flyPanAm()</code></p>
