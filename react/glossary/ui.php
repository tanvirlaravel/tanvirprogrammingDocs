           <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div>
                <p>User interface (UI) refers to the part of a software or a computer system that allows users to interact with it. It is the graphical representation of the software or system that includes buttons, menus, icons, and other visual elements that users can use to communicate with the system.</p>
                <p>The primary goal of a user interface is to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows users to interact with the system in a meaningful way. A well-designed UI can make it easier for users to complete tasks and achieve their goals efficiently.</p>
                <p>There are several types of user interfaces, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs), command-line interfaces (CLIs), and natural language interfaces. GUIs are the most common type of user interface and are used in most software applications today. They are usually based on windows, menus, and icons and are designed to be easy to navigate using a mouse or touch screen.</p>
