                <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is primarily used to create interactive front-end web applications. It is a versatile language that can also be used on the server-side with technologies such as Node.js. JavaScript code is executed by a browser or JavaScript engine, and it can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to <code>change the appearance and content of a web page in real-time</code>. It can also be used to make web and mobile apps, games, and software, in general, more interactive and dynamic. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS.</p>
