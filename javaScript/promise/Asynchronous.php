      <h3>Asynchronous programming</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Asynchronous programming refers to the ability of a program or function to perform multiple tasks concurrently, rather than sequentially. This allows a program to perform multiple tasks at the same time, rather than waiting for one task to complete before starting the next one.</p>
        <p>Asynchronous programming is often used in scenarios where a task may take a long time to complete, such as making a network request or reading a large file from disk. By performing these tasks asynchronously, a program can continue to perform other tasks while the asynchronous task is being completed, rather than being blocked or stalled. This can improve the performance and responsiveness of a program.</p>
        <p>There are several ways to perform asynchronous programming in JavaScript, including using Promises, async/await, and callback functions.</p>

      <h3>Promises</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Promises are a language feature that provide a mechanism to handle asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like style. They enable you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code, making it easier to reason about and work with.</p>

      <h3>Async/await</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Async/await is a syntax that makes it easier to work with Promises and asynchronous code. It allows you to write asynchronous code using a synchronous-like syntax, making it easier to read and understand.</p>

      <h3>Callback functions</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Callback functions are a way to pass a function as an argument to another function, and have it be called when the task is complete. This allows you to perform asynchronous tasks by passing a callback function that will be called when the task is complete.</p>
