         <h2>Introduction</h2>
         <p>strings — this is what pieces of text are called in programming.</p>

         <h2>The power of words</h2>
         <p>Words are very important to humans — they are a large part of how we communicate. Since the Web is a largely text-based medium designed to allow humans to communicate and share information, it is useful for us to have control over the words that appear on it.</p>
         <p>HTML provides structure and meaning to our text, CSS allows us to precisely style it, and JavaScript contains a number of features for manipulating strings,creating custom welcome messages and prompts, showing the right text labels when needed, sorting terms into the desired order, and much more.</p>
