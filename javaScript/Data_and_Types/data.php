            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div>
                <p>In programming, data refers to the values or information that a program processes and manipulates. Data can be of various types, such as numbers, strings, booleans, and objects, and it can be stored in different data structures, such as variables, arrays, and objects.</p>
                <p>Data can be input into a program through various sources, such as user input, files, or databases, and it can be output in various forms, such as text, images, or other types of files.</p>
                <p>Data can also be transformed and manipulated by a program through various operations and algorithms, such as sorting, filtering, and aggregating.</p>
                <p>In addition, data can be organized and structured in different ways, such as in tables, lists, or trees, depending on the requirements of the program and the specific problem it is trying to solve.</p>
                <p>Overall, data is a fundamental aspect of programming, as it is the input and output of a program, and it drives the logic and functionality of a program.</p>
