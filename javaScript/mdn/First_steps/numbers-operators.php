<p class="bg-warning p-2">Note: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon (;) — your code may work correctly for single lines, but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.</p>

<p class="bg-warning p-2">Note: Don't confuse a variable that exists but has no defined value with a variable that doesn't exist at all — they are very different things. In the box analogy you saw above, not existing would mean there's no box (variable) for a value to go in. No value defined would mean that there IS a box, but it has no value inside it.</p>
