           <h3>integers numbers</h3>
           <div>
             <p>Integers are a set of numbers that include all whole numbers (positive and negative) and zero (0). They are represented using the symbol "Z" and are a subset of the set of real numbers, which includes both integers and fractional numbers. Integers are commonly used in mathematical operations and computer programming, as well as in everyday situations, such as measuring temperature or weight, or counting money. In computer programming, integers are often used as data types and are represented by INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT and others. They can be used to represent values such as counts, ID numbers, and other numeric values that do not require a decimal component.</p>

           <h3>Whole numbers</h3>
           <div>
             <p>Whole numbers are a set of numbers that include all positive integers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...) and zero (0), but do not include negative numbers or fractional numbers. They are also known as non-negative integers or natural numbers. Whole numbers are used in a variety of fields such as counting, measuring, and mathematical operations. They are often represented using the symbol "Z" and are a subset of integers. Whole numbers are commonly used in many everyday situations, such as counting objects or measuring quantities, and are also used in computer programming and database management as data types like INT or BIGINT.</p>

           <h3>fractional numbers</h3>
           <div>
             <p>Fractional numbers, also known as rational numbers, are numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. They can be represented in the form of a fraction, such as 3/4 or -5/8. They include both positive and negative numbers, as well as zero. They can also be represented as decimal numbers, such as 0.75 or -0.625. They are a subset of the set of real numbers, which also include irrational numbers, such as √2 or π. In computer programming, fractional numbers are often represented by the data type called floating point, like float or double. These data types can store decimal fractions with a high precision. They are commonly used in mathematical operations, physics and engineering calculations, financial and scientific computations.

           <h3>natural numbers</h3>
           <div>
             <p>A natural number is a positive integer, also known as a whole number. These numbers are often used for counting and ordering things, and are represented by the symbol "N". They start from 1 and go on indefinitely, without any fractional or decimal component. They are commonly used in mathematical operations and computer programming, as well as in everyday situations, such as counting objects or measuring quantities. In computer programming, natural numbers are often used as data types and are represented by INT, BIGINT, SMALLINT and others. They can be used to represent values such as counts, ID numbers, and other numeric values that do not require a fractional or decimal component.</p>

           <h3>binary data</h3>
           <div>
             <p>Binary data refers to data that is stored and transmitted in a binary format, which uses only two symbols, typically "0" and "1" to represent all types of data. This is in contrast to data stored in a text format, which uses a set of alphanumeric characters to represent data.</p>
             <p>Binary data is often used to store and transmit multimedia files, such as images, audio, and video, as well as executable files, such as software programs. It is also commonly used in communication protocols, such as TCP/IP, and in low-level data storage, such as hard drives and memory.</p>
             <p>In a computer, all data is stored in binary format, as all information is ultimately represented as a series of on and off electrical signals in memory or storage. When we deal with text, images, audio or video, these files are first converted to binary format before storage or transmission, and then converted back to their original format for display or use.</p>
