             <p>In the context of Laravel's database query builder, when we mention "interface," we are not referring to the concept of an interface in object-oriented programming. Instead, we are talking about the interface provided by Laravel's query builder, which refers to the set of methods and the fluent chainable syntax it offers for building and executing database queries.</p>
             <p>In this case, the term "interface" is used more loosely to describe the way you interact with the query builder, rather than the formal concept of an interface in programming.</p>
             <p>Laravel's query builder provides a convenient and fluent interface by allowing you to chain methods together to construct your database queries in a readable and expressive manner. This fluent interface makes it easier to build complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, manageable pieces.</p>

           		<pre>
     $users = DB::table('users')
            ->select('name', 'email')
            ->where('age', '>', 18)
            ->orderBy('name')
            ->get();

           		</pre>
             <p>In this example, the query builder methods (table, select, where, orderBy, and get) are chained together using the arrow (->) syntax. Each method call modifies the query and returns an instance of the query builder, allowing you to chain subsequent methods.</p>
             <p>This fluent interface allows you to easily understand and visualize the construction of the query. You start with the table you want to query (table('users')), then specify the columns you want to select (select('name', 'email')), apply a condition (where('age', '>', 18)), and finally sort the results (orderBy('name')). The get() method executes the query and returns the results.</p>
             <p>By providing a fluent interface, Laravel's query builder enhances the readability and maintainability of your code. It allows you to write database queries in a more natural and expressive way, without the need for complex string concatenation or manual SQL statement construction.</p>
