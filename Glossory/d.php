            <h3 id="foreign-key">Driver</h3>
            <p>A database driver is a software component that allows an application to communicate with a specific database management system (DBMS). It acts as an interface between the application and the database, providing the necessary functionality to establish a connection, send queries, and retrieve results.</p>
            <p>Different database management systems have their own specific protocols and APIs for interacting with databases. Therefore, each DBMS requires a specific driver to facilitate communication with that particular system.</p>
            <p>In the context of PHP and web development, popular database drivers include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>MySQL: The MySQL driver allows PHP applications to connect to and interact with MySQL databases.</li>
                <li>PostgreSQL: The PostgreSQL driver enables PHP applications to work with PostgreSQL databases.</li>
                <li>SQLite: The SQLite driver allows PHP applications to utilize SQLite databases.</li>
                <li>SQL Server: The SQL Server driver allows PHP applications to connect to and interact with Microsoft SQL Server databases.</li>
                <li>Oracle: The Oracle driver enables PHP applications to work with Oracle databases.</li>
                
            </ol>
            <p>These database drivers provide the necessary functions and methods to establish connections, execute queries, fetch results, and manage transactions with their respective database management systems.</p>
            <p>In a PHP application, you typically specify the desired database driver and configure the necessary connection details (e.g., hostname, username, password, database name) in the application's configuration files or environment variables. This information is then used by the chosen database driver to establish a connection to the appropriate database.</p>

            <h3>Decimal number </h3>
            <div>
                <p>A decimal number, also known as a base-10 number, is a number that uses a numbering system based on powers of 10. In the decimal system, there are 10 digits (0-9) that can be used to represent numbers.</p>
                <p>The decimal system uses a positional notation, meaning that the value of each digit depends on its position or place value in the number. The rightmost digit represents the units place, the next digit to the left represents the tens place, the next digit represents the hundreds place, and so on.</p>
                <br>

                <p>For example, let's consider the decimal number 235.78:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The digit 5 is in the units place, so it represents 5 units.</li>
                    <li>The digit 3 is in the tens place, so it represents 3 tens (30).</li>
                    <li>The digit 2 is in the hundreds place, so it represents 2 hundreds (200).</li>
                    <li>The digit 7 is in the tenths place, so it represents 7 tenths (0.7).</li>
                    <li>The digit 8 is in the hundredths place, so it represents 8 hundredths (0.08).</li>
                   
                </ul>
                <p>When these values are added together, the decimal number 235.78 represents a total value of 200 + 30 + 5 + 0.7 + 0.08 = 235.78.</p>
                <p>Decimal numbers are widely used in everyday life for various purposes, including counting, measurements, and monetary transactions. They are commonly used in decimal notation to represent fractional parts of a whole number, where the decimal point separates the whole number part from the fractional part.</p>
                <p>The decimal system is intuitive and familiar to most people since it is the numbering system we use in our daily lives. It provides a convenient and easy way to represent and work with numbers in various mathematical operations.</p>
