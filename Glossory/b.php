             <h3>binary data</h3>
            
             <p>Binary data refers to data that is stored and transmitted in a binary format, which uses only two symbols, typically "0" and "1" to represent all types of data. This is in contrast to data stored in a text format, which uses a set of alphanumeric characters to represent data.</p>
             <p>Binary data is often used to store and transmit multimedia files, such as images, audio, and video, as well as executable files, such as software programs. It is also commonly used in communication protocols, such as TCP/IP, and in low-level data storage, such as hard drives and memory.</p>
             <p>In a computer, all data is stored in binary format, as all information is ultimately represented as a series of on and off electrical signals in memory or storage. When we deal with text, images, audio or video, these files are first converted to binary format before storage or transmission, and then converted back to their original format for display or use.</p>
