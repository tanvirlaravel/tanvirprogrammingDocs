            <h1>Inheritance</h1> 

            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div>
               <p>One of the main advantages of object-oriented programming is the ability to reduce code duplication with inheritance. Code duplication occurs when a programmer writes the same code more than once, a problem that inheritance strives to solve. In inheritance, we have a parent class with its own methods and properties, and a child class (or classes) that can use the code from the parent. By using inheritance, we can create a reusable piece of code that we write only once in the parent class, and use again as much as we need in the child classes</p>
