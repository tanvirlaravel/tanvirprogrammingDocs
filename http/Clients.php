      <h3>Defination</h3>
      <div>
        <p>HTTP clients are <code>devices or software</code> that send HTTP requests to servers. Some examples of HTTP clients include:
</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><span>Web browsers </span></strong>: These are the most common type of HTTP client. Web browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari send HTTP requests to web servers to retrieve and display web pages.</li>
            <li><strong><span>Mobile apps </span></strong>: Many mobile apps use HTTP to communicate with servers, either to retrieve data or to send data such as user input or device information.</li>
            <li><strong><span> Command-line tools</span></strong>: These are programs that can be run from the command line or terminal, and allow users to send HTTP requests manually. Examples include curl and wget.</li>
            <li><strong><span>Libraries and frameworks </span></strong>: These are software libraries or frameworks that provide HTTP client functionality for developers to use in their own programs. Examples include the requests library in Python and the HttpClient class in .NET.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>HTTP clients send HTTP requests to servers using the appropriate method (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URL. The client may also include additional headers or data in the request, depending on the specific needs of the application. The server responds with an HTTP response, which includes a status code, headers, and potentially data. The client processes the response and may display the data or take other actions based on the response.</p>
