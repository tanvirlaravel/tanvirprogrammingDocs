      <h3>Defination</h3>
      <div>
        <p>In the context of the web and networking, a request is a message sent by a client to a server asking for some kind of information or service. The request typically includes a method (such as GET or POST), a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and headers (additional information about the request). The server responds to the request with a response, which typically includes a status code (indicating whether the request was successful), headers (additional information about the response), and a body (the data or content that was requested).</p>
        
        <p>Here is an example of a simple HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request:</p>
        
        <pre>
        GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
        Host: www.example.com
        Accept: text/html

        </pre>

        <p>In this example, the client is using the GET method to request the index.html file from the www.example.com server. The server responds with a response that includes the requested file and a status code indicating the status of the request.</p>

        <p>Requests are an important part of how the web works, as they enable clients (such as web browsers) to access resources and services provided by servers. They are also used in many other contexts, such as mobile app development and data analysis, to access data and functionality from other systems or services.</p>
