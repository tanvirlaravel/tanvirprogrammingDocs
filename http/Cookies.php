        <p>HTTP cookies are <code>small pieces of data</code> that are stored by a client's web browser and sent back to the server with every subsequent request. They are often used to remember information about the user, such as their language preference or login status, and to track their activity on a website.</p>
        
        <p>Cookies are created by the server and sent to the client as part of the HTTP response header. The client's web browser then stores the cookie and includes it with every subsequent request to the same server. This allows the server to maintain state and personalize the user's experience.</p> 

        <p>Cookies have a name, a value, and optional attributes such as an expiration date and a domain. They are stored on the client's computer in a text file.</p>

        <p>Cookies can be set to expire after a certain amount of time, or they can be set to persist indefinitely. They can also be set to only be sent over secure connections (HTTPS).</p>

        <p>Cookies can be useful for a variety of purposes, such as remembering user preferences, tracking user activity, and personalizing the user's experience. However, they can also be used for tracking and targeting users for advertising purposes, which has raised concerns about privacy. Many web browsers allow users to block or delete cookies, or to choose which cookies to accept.</p>
